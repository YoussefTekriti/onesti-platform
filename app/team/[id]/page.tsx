    fullBio: `After graduating with my BA, I worked as a Grade 1 homeroom teacher. While teaching, I received my Special Education diploma and started a Special Education department at the school.

I co-founded the first early intervention center in Lebanon, and as a service coordinator I successfully developed operations, worked on capacity building, and coordinated five therapy departments, each in its own entity and as a collaborative interdisciplinary team. In addition to initiating a home visiting department, which was also an innovative service in Lebanon. As head of the early intervention unit, I successfully developed the operations and coordinated four additional specialty departments: medical intervention, nutrition, counseling, and social intervention that were merged to the early intervention unit.

I gained valuable experience working at an international non profit organization. I provided capacity building to UNICEF partners on Inclusive Education. Performed mentoring visits to UNICEF implementing partners. Monitored activities in the centers, and communities in regards to inclusive education. Coordinated with other international and local organizations, local government and other stakeholders in the area of education, disability, and child protection.

With ONESTI, I aim for a far more challenging endeavor, and that is, for specialized intervention services to reach every child and family. Via advanced technology and high professional standards, we can change lives for the better across the globe. Yes I am a firm believer in serving humanity and this is at the core of my existence and that of ONESTI.

I'm constantly thinking of ways we can raise the awareness of communities on the importance of intervention and ways to reach the families whose lives and their children's future can tremendously improve with provision of services.

To find balance and clear my head, I find peace in nature. I go on hikes, I contemplate its greatness and its intricacies. I am the mother of two boys, and despite all the success, this fact remains my life's biggest achievement and greatest joy.`,

    fullBio: `I hold a Bachelor's degree in English Language (American University of Beirut) and a Teaching Diploma with a dual emphasis in Early Childhood Education and Teaching Math & Science/Elementary (Lebanese American University). Following a spate of explosions and the 2006 war, having borne witness to the trauma that ensued, I pursued a Master's degree in Counseling Children and Young People (University of Nottingham). After stumbling upon the science of behavior/learning, I completed the BACB Course Sequence through FIT's online program, and became board certified in 2012.

I am now a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), working with children (both neurotypical and those with special needs) and their families, to facilitate their acquisition of pre-academic/academic skills and developmental milestones, as well working on replacing problem behavior with adaptive behavior. I also offer workshops on various topics, ranging from functions of behavior to evidence-based approaches to the treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder and other developmental disabilities. Moreover, I develop individual education plans/behavior protocols, and train/supervise family members, paraprofessionals, and RBT/BCaBA/BCBA candidates in their implementation.

I have, over the years, been implementing the Orton-Gillingham and other Science of Reading aligned approaches in working with students with Dyslexia/reading difficulties. I have also received training in such assessment/curriculum programs as VB-MAPP (Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program), EFL (Essential for Living), and PEAK Training System, in addition to attending workshops related to such areas as pediatric feeding disorders and the functional analysis of problem behavior. I have received training in Dr Greg Hanley's Practical Functional Assessment (PFA) and Interview-Informed, Synthesized Contingency Analysis (IISCA), and was amongst the first in Lebanon to administer it (and subsequently develop Skill-Based Treatment of Problem Behavior). I am also a certified Professional Crisis Management (PCM) Instructor (PS).

In 2017, I co-founded the Association for Behavior Analysis â€“ Lebanon (ABAL), the Lebanese chapter of the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI). I was subsequently elected as ABAL's first President.`,

Meanwhile, in 2014, I began my journey in early intervention. Working with children with disabilities and developmental delays enriched my experience and became a passion of mine. I worked in different settings such as day care centers, schools, home, and nonprofit organizations. The one thing I found to be common in the different settings was that behavioral challenges are a major barrier in children's progress across contexts. That's what inspired me to delve into the field of behavior intervention. So I decided to continue my career path as a behavior therapist. During this phase I had the chance to work in a multidisciplinary team whereI refined my skills under the supervision of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, BCBA.

In addition to all my years of experience, I can say that one of my greatest learning opportunities was being a mother of two boys. Having my own family as my rock, played a significant role in my drive to help other families build healthy relationships and maintain a healthy family dynamic.

My workday is a joy, yet strenuous and that is why I end my day in my calm place, which is yoga. That is where I find peace and maintain my balance.`,

I implemented this broad perspective in creating a pediatric occupational therapy intervention unit that reflected a progressive and comprehensive mode of service provision at an early intervention center.

After 12 years of cumulative experience and continuous development, I found that it was time to share my knowledge more extensively. At ONESTI, I will be able to use my expertise to serve any individual wherever they are and help them reach their fullest potential.

My work is not only a passion but I also consider it my favorite hobby. I will explain whyâ€¦ it's because a lot of what I do as an occupational therapist includes all types of art! I use my love for hand-crafts to customize technical aids.

I use my talent in design to adapt and modify the environment to suit every child. I am in my creative element when I create individualized sensory tools. So now you can see how I have a hobby for a job.`,
